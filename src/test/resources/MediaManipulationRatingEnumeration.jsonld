In general these codes are not mutually exclusive, although some combinations (such as 'original' versus 'transformed', 'edited' and 'staged') would be contradictory if applied in the same [[MediaReview]]. Note that the application of these codes is with regard to a piece of media shared or published in a particular context.",
