  "rdfs:comment": "A series of [[Event]]s. Included events can relate with the series using the [[superEvent]] property.\n\nAn EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, \"The Olympic Games\" is a series, which\nis repeated regularly. The \"2012 London Olympics\" can be presented both as an [[Event]] in the series \"Olympic Games\", and as an\n[[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.\n\nThe nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples could\ninclude a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.\n\nEventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without\nworrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries\nmay seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but\nit may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.\n   ",
